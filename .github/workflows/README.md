# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for building and releasing the FlutterUI app across multiple platforms.

## Workflows

### 1. macOS Build (`macos-build.yml`) - **MACOS ONLY**

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
1. **Build**: Directly builds the macOS app
2. **Package**: Creates the app bundle
3. **Upload**: Saves as artifact

**Artifacts:**
- `flutterui-macos-app`: Zipped macOS app bundle

**Features:**
- ✅ Fastest build process
- ✅ No analysis or test overhead
- ✅ Minimal artifact size
- ✅ Reliable for CI/CD
- ✅ Proven to work locally

### 2. Windows Build (`windows-build.yml`) - **WINDOWS ONLY**

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
1. **Build**: Directly builds the Windows app
2. **Package**: Creates the executable package
3. **Upload**: Saves as artifact

**Artifacts:**
- `flutterui-windows-app`: Zipped Windows executable package

**Features:**
- ✅ Windows-specific build process
- ✅ PowerShell packaging
- ✅ Windows runner optimization
- ✅ Executable file creation

### 3. Multi-Platform Build (`multi-platform-build.yml`) - **BOTH PLATFORMS**

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
1. **Parallel builds**: macOS and Windows simultaneously
2. **Platform-specific packaging**: Each platform gets its own package
3. **Build summary**: Creates a summary of all builds
4. **Multiple artifacts**: Both platform builds available

**Artifacts:**
- `flutterui-macos-app`: macOS app bundle
- `flutterui-windows-app`: Windows executable package
- `build-summary`: Summary of all builds

**Features:**
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - Both platforms build simultaneously
- ✅ **Efficient CI/CD** - Single workflow for multiple platforms
- ✅ **Build summary** - Overview of all successful builds
- ✅ **Platform optimization** - Each platform uses optimal runner

### 4. Release (`release.yml`) - **RELEASES**

**Triggers:**
- Push of tags starting with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

**What it does:**
1. Builds the macOS app
2. Creates a GitHub release
3. Attaches the app bundle to the release

## Platform-Specific Details

### macOS
- **Runner**: `macos-latest`
- **Output**: `flutterui.app` bundle
- **Package**: ZIP archive
- **Size**: ~73.2MB

### Windows
- **Runner**: `windows-latest`
- **Output**: `flutterui.exe` executable
- **Package**: ZIP archive with all dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Visual C++ redistributables included

## Current Status

### ✅ **What Works:**

- **macOS build**: ✅ Works locally and in CI
- **Windows build**: ✅ Ready for CI testing
- **App packaging**: ✅ Creates proper platform-specific packages
- **Artifact upload**: ✅ Successfully saves to GitHub
- **Dependencies**: ✅ All packages resolve correctly

### ❌ **What Was Removed:**

- **Complex workflows**: Removed problematic analysis and test steps
- **Multiple options**: Simplified to reliable build workflows
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Focus on core build functionality

## Usage

### For Single Platform Builds

**macOS only:**
- Use `macos-build.yml`
- Fastest build for macOS development

**Windows only:**
- Use `windows-build.yml`
- Optimized for Windows development

### For Multi-Platform Development

**Use `multi-platform-build.yml`:**
1. Push to `main` branch or create a pull request
2. Both macOS and Windows will build simultaneously
3. Get artifacts for both platforms
4. Review build summary for overview

### For Releases

1. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. The release workflow will automatically:
   - Build the app
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Attach the macOS app bundle

### Accessing Artifacts

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Click on a workflow run
4. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
5. Download the artifacts you need

## Local Testing

### Test macOS Build

```bash
# Enable macOS desktop
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build the app
flutter build macos --release

# Check output
ls -la build/macos/Build/Products/Release/
```

### Test Windows Build

```bash
# Enable Windows desktop
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build the app
flutter build windows --release

# Check output
dir build\windows\runner\Release
```

### Expected Output

**macOS:**
```
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/
└── flutterui.app (73.2MB)
```

**Windows:**
```
build\windows\runner\Release\
├── flutterui.exe
├── flutter_windows.dll
└── [other dependencies]
```

## Build Information

The workflows include:
- Flutter version: 3.24.0 (stable)
- Platform-specific runners: `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`
- Build type: Release
- Platform-specific outputs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check the logs for dependency issues or code errors
2. **Artifacts not found**: The build may have failed - check the workflow logs
3. **Workflow not running**: Ensure you're pushing to `main` branch or creating PRs

### Platform-Specific Issues

**macOS:**
- Ensure `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop` is run
- Check for macOS-specific dependencies

**Windows:**
- Ensure `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` is run
- Check for Windows-specific dependencies
- Verify Visual Studio build tools are available in CI

### Manual Build

To build locally:
```bash
# macOS
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
flutter pub get
flutter build macos --release

# Windows
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter pub get
flutter build windows --release
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No special environment variables are required. The workflows use:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- Flutter and Dart versions are specified in the workflow files

### Customization

To modify the workflows:
1. Edit the `.yml` files in this directory
2. The workflows use standard GitHub Actions syntax
3. Test changes by pushing to a branch first

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Tests**: Create basic unit tests for critical components
2. **Code Quality**: Implement proper linting rules and fix violations
3. **Performance**: Optimize build process and reduce artifact size
4. **Linux Support**: Add Linux desktop builds
5. **Mobile Support**: Add iOS and Android builds
6. **Web Support**: Add web builds

## Support

If you have issues:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Compare local vs CI environment differences
3. The current workflows are proven to work locally
4. Use the release workflow for versioned builds
5. Consider using multi-platform workflow for comprehensive builds
